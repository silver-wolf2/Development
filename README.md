### Silver Wolf - Web3 Solidity Projects

Welcome to my Solidity learning and Web3 development repository! üöÄ
This is a collection of small smart contract projects that I have built to improve my skills in blockchain development and decentralized application (dApp) creation.

#### üìö About the Repository

##### This repository includes:
	‚Ä¢	ERC20-token: Basic ERC-20 token implementation with tests.
	‚Ä¢	FundMe: Smart contract allowing users to fund and withdraw Ether.
	‚Ä¢	Lottery: A decentralized lottery smart contract.
	‚Ä¢	NFT: Basic NFT (ERC-721) smart contract.
	‚Ä¢	eth-todo-list: To-Do List decentralized application using Web3.js and Truffle.

##### Each project includes:
	‚Ä¢	Smart contracts written in Solidity.
	‚Ä¢	Deployment scripts using Truffle.
	‚Ä¢	Front-end interaction examples using Web3.js.

The purpose of these projects is purely educational and focused on gaining hands-on experience with smart contracts, deployments, and dApp front-end integration.
