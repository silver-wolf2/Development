### FundMe ‚Äì Decentralized Crowdfunding Smart Contract

FundMe is a basic yet powerful Solidity project that allows users to send ETH and enables the owner to withdraw the funds. This project is part of my learning journey in Web3 and smart contract development.

#### üîç Project Description

The FundMe smart contract provides a simple crowdfunding mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain.
	‚Ä¢	Users can fund the contract with ETH.
	‚Ä¢	The owner of the contract can withdraw the funds.
	‚Ä¢	Minimum funding amount is enforced via price feeds using Chainlink (in the advanced version).

This is a practical example of:
	‚Ä¢	Access control (only owner can withdraw)
	‚Ä¢	ETH value conversion (optional using Chainlink)
	‚Ä¢	Handling payable functions and fallback mechanisms
