### NFT – Basic ERC-721 Smart Contract

This project implements a simple ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) using Solidity.
It serves as an educational foundation for creating, minting, and managing NFTs on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

#### 🎯 Project Overview
	•	Smart contract that follows the ERC-721 standard
	•	Allows the contract owner to mint NFTs to a given address
	•	Each NFT has a unique token ID and optional metadata URI
	•	Built with OpenZeppelin contracts for security and standardization

This is part of my personal Web3 development journey to gain practical skills with NFT standards and smart contract best practices.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Solidity (v0.8.x)
	•	Truffle – Compilation, deployment, and testing
	•	Ganache – Local blockchain for testing
	•	OpenZeppelin – Reusable ERC-721 implementation
	•	IPFS or centralized URI (optional) – For metadata
